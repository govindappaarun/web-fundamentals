# Prerequistes üõ¥
In order to start learning the web fundamentals, here are some of the prerequistes that I would like to recommend

- System - (Laptop / Desktop )
  - Any of the modern OS ( Windows / Linux / Mac ) with  4GB of Ram / 256GB of Harddisk
  - Have SSD drive hard disk if you are using an old laptop, this will improve the speed of the sytem
    - SSD replacement is very easy and less cost than buying a new laptop
  - RAM of 8GB is prefered, but 4GB is also fine

- If you dont have any system
  - Dont invest to much money on new system, as it would be short term used, once after the job you get very good system at work usually
  - Try to buy one refurbished laptop with above configuration works

- Using Mobile Device
  - Works to an extent, and can only be used to practice minimal syntax
  - Difficult to do debugging and also integrating many files 
    
- Editor - for wirting programs
  - Standalone editors available like
     - notepad
     - notepad++
     - VSCODE  üëç
     - SUBLime editor / Eclipse / IntelliJ
  - Online editors 
     - [codepen.io](https://codepen.io)  üëç
     - [onecompiler.com](http://onecompiler.com)
     - [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/)
     - [https://codesandbox.io/](https://codesandbox.io/)  üëç 
    Do create an account in anyof the above, it will help to persist all the practices online, which would make accessing and practicing bit system independent and sync across devices.
